Bonferonni correction: divide the alpha value by the number of tests

Holm-Bonferroni Method: It is a modification of the Bonferroni correction. The Bonferroni correction reduces the possibility of 
getting a statistically significant result (i.e. a Type I error) when performing multiple tests. Although the Bonferroni is 
simple to calculate, it suffers from a lack of statistical power. The Holm-Bonferroni method is also fairly simple to 
calculate, but it is more powerful than the single-step Bonferroni. https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/holm-bonferroni-method/
